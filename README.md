# 📟 Carevia Dashboard (Portal)

### **Enterprise Provider & Admin Management Interface**
*A specialized, high-performance portal designed for healthcare providers to manage clinical workflows, payments, and real-time patient interactions.*

---

## 🏗️ Project Role
This is the **decoupled frontend** of the Carevia ecosystem. It functions as a standalone Single Page Application (SPA) designed for administrators and healthcare professionals, providing a streamlined, low-latency interface for operational management.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Intent

- **Vite + React 19:** Optimized for lightning-fast HMR and minimal bundle size, providing a snappy experience for heavy dashboard usage.
- **TanStack Query (React Query):** 
    - Handles asynchronous state management.
    - Implements **stale-while-revalidate** caching.
    - Simplifies pagination and dynamic filtering logic.
- **Socket.io Client:** Maintains a persistent connection to the `carevia-socket` server for real-time booking alerts.
- **Axios Secure Interceptor:** Automatically attaches JWT Bearer tokens to every request, shared seamlessly with the Next.js backend.
- **DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS:** Modular UI components with a "Glassmorphism" design approach for a premium professional look.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Booking Feed:** Instant toast notifications (via `sonner`) when a new booking is confirmed.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** UI dynamically adapts for Admin vs. Provider roles.
- **Dynamic Data Filtering:** Sophisticated filtering for payments and bookings (Sort, Search, Division-based filters) powered by TanStack Query.
- **JWT Persistence:** Secure session management via localized storage with automatic 401 redirection on token expiry.
- **Work in Progress:** Real-time chat integration is currently in the active development roadmap.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js v20+
   - Access to the Carevia Backend (.env setup)

2. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration:**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
   VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🧠 Engineering Highlights

### **Hybrid Auth Integration**
The dashboard uses a common `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to verify tokens generated by the Next.js parent app. This allows a user to log in on the main site and access the dashboard without redundant logins, provided the domain-sharing or token-passing logic is met.

### **Server-State Management**
Instead of polluting global state (Redux/Context) with server data, we use **React Query**. This ensures that the data is always fresh, eliminates unnecessary API calls, and provides out-of-the-box loading/error states for a superior UX.
